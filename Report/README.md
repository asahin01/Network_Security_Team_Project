Please save your work in this repository, either on your own branch or the develop branch. When you are ready create a Pull Request to merge it in to the master branch so that others can review it - add the other team members as reviewers on the PR.  This will give us a chance to see what is being done and comment on it.

Where possible please use text files, e.g. source code, markdown, ipython notebooks etc.  This allows us to view any changes that have been made.
